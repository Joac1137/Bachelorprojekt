Graphs
    - Create seperate file with testing examples (for generating graphs) - maybe start we small example (Not karate club)
    - Give edges weights
    - Give edges direction

Moran Process
    Methods
        - Step -> Fix death so we based it upon weights
        - Have a mutate method
        - Create the numeric_fixation_probability method

Observations
    - Create graph that shows whether the graph has fixated or are extinct (iterations / time)
    - Write out the modified Moran Process

Greedy algorithm
    -Baby-names:
        - BigBadBoi_KarlJohan
        - BilboBopIns
        - יְהוֹיָקִים‎
        - אסגר
        - ḥănît_yehoyaqim (asger and joachim meaning in hebrew)
    - Node selection
        - Run k times, in each round select best choice, run again in the new setting

Solutions
    - Create method for brute forcing optimal choice of active nodes
    - Create greedy algorithm for selecting active nodes (see above for names)
    - Figure out how to save results (Save results of optimal active node choices) log
    - Compare results (Brute vs. greedy)


Numerical fixation probability
    - Figure out how to do this
    - Compare numerical solution to simulation results

Missing Testing
    - Does 'Random' choice of edge work with different weights
    - Does 'Random' choice of node work
    - Does a change to the multiplier properly work (do we increase fixation prob by increasing the multiplier)

Todo:
26/2
    - Directed graph 🗸
    - weighted graph 🗸
    - describe modified moran process
    - Possibly write code for brute forcing optimal choice of active nodes
    - Refactor?
