Graphs
    - Create seperate file with testing examples (for generating graphs) - maybe start we small example (Not karate club)
    - Give edges weights
    - Give edges direction
    - When creating a graph you should be able to specify graph size as argument

Moran Process
    Methods
        - Step -> Fix death so we based it upon weights
        - Have a mutate method
        - Create the numeric_fixation_probability method

Simulation
    - Should take graph as argument

Observations
    - Create graph that shows whether the graph has fixated or are extinct (iterations / time)
    - Write out the modified Moran Process

Greedy algorithm

        - אסגר
        - ḥănît_yehoyaqim (asger and joachim meaning in hebrew)
    - Node selection
        - Run k times, in each round select best choice, run again in the new setting

Solutions
    - Create method for brute forcing optimal choice of active nodes
    - Create greedy algorithm for selecting active nodes (see above for names)
    - Figure out how to save results (Save results of optimal active node choices) log
    - Compare results (Brute vs. greedy)


Numerical fixation probability
    - Figure out how to do this
    - Compare numerical solution to simulation results

Missing Testing
    - Does 'Random' choice of edge work with different weights
    - Does 'Random' choice of node work
    - Does a change to the multiplier properly work (do we increase fixation prob by increasing the multiplier)

Markov Model
    - Figure out how to formulate a linear problem from the markov model
    - Transition probability on edges (can probably do in advance, f(k->k+1) probabilities
    - We have created the model from the initial(maybe) model and therefore the type of nodes in a markov modes might not be mutant

    - Directed graph 🗸
    - weighted graph 🗸
    - Describe modified Moran Process 🗸
    - Possibly write code for brute forcing optimal choice of active nodes
    - Refactor?


Todo:
5/3
    - Define Modified Moran Process
        - Based on articles
    - Modify simulation code to take multipliers into account
    - Modify numeric code to take multipliers into account
    - Run numeric solution for all 'small' graphs
        - Run on all strongly connected graphs for a k nodes


Todo:
12/3
    - Modify numeric code to take multipliers into account (Check that you hit the same as before with multiplier = 1) 🗸
    - Create Activate node function that makes a node active
        - Create Active node chooser class that takes budget of k nodes and a choosing strategy (greedy, heuristics) and a graph
        - Does the concrete strategies actually make the nodes active or do they just indicate which to choose?
        - Greedy:
            - Tie Breaker between same probabilities for different nodes. Might just pick the smallest index one
            - Should we return the graph where we have chosen the k_nodes?
            - Might need to do some rounding when comparing the probabilities
            - Delete "graph.nodes[i]['multiplier'] = 20"
    - Create histograms
        - Possibilities to Change:
            - Number of Nodes
            - Fitness r
            - Multiplier (only relevant if we are using active nodes)
        - Insert vertical line for fixation probability for fully connected graph 🗸
        - Could potentially also insert vertical line for fixation probability for fully star graph (no discussed)
        - Save the histograms
            - Especially for the large n
            - Maybe r=1 is most relevant
    - Refactor MP and Graphs
    - Graphs
        - Fitness_individual vs fitness. The fitness_individual is always 1 because we never change someone to 'mutant'. Seems as if we should use fitness which is the mutant fitness but they give the same result?
        - Can we have it such that different mutants can have different fitness? If not then it is fine to just use the given 'fitness'. Otherwise we need to think :(
            - If they have to be the same then it might be beneficial to provide with a 'mutant fitness' property such that it can we access through the graph
        - How do we initialize the multipliers?
