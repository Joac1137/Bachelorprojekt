Graphs
    - Create seperate file with testing examples (for generating graphs) - maybe start we small example (Not karate club)
    - Give edges weights
    - Give edges direction

Moran Process
    Methods
        - Step -> Fix death so we based it upon weights
        - Have a mutate method
        - Create the numeric_fixation_probability method

Observations
    - Create graph that shows whether the graph has fixated or are extinct (iterations / time)
